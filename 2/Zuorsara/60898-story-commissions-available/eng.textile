Hi!

Based on what people on this site have said to me, I'm willing to do commissions for people for omorashi literature!

I'd love for you to visit my Fiverr account and if you want to talk to me on omo.org about your commissions that's great as well

Absolutely!

I can't promise that I'll be familiar with the fanfiction, but I'll certainly give it my best shot.

What fanfiction did you have in mind?

I was thinking sitcoms like Community, That 70s Show, Boy Meets World, Roseanne, Parks and Recreation, etc

I haven't watched any of those, but I can investigate them if you're interested in a commission. If you private message me can discuss further details.

Are you willing to write an original story and do maybe some world-building plotting for the world/universe that the story is going to be based in?

Yes, I'm totally willing to do that.
